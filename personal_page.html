		<p style = "color:white">Hello My name is Cloee Kunstek and I am a freshman in Carmel High School. I have many pets including: one dog, one cat, one turtle, two fish, and nine chickens. But only two of them actually like me, my dog and sometimes my cat, so I am looking to get a pet snake. I like to draw but I am horrible at it. During the school year I play French Horn in Concert Band.  I also play mellophone in am in Marching band during the summer and fall, but I don’t do much for the rest of the year. I am interested in video games and often play them in my free time, my favorites including Pokémon, Legend of Zelda, and Overwatch.</p> 

		<p style = "color:white">I dislike going out altogether and will look for any excuse to stay home. Despite my home’s location in the Carmel Clay School District I actually live in Zionsville, so everything is far away. This brings up the issue of libraries, seeing as I can walk to the Zionsville library faster than I can drive to the Carmel one. Because of this, the only time I can really check out books is during the school year. Luckily most of my favorite book series are still being wrote. Thanks for reading my bio!</p>
