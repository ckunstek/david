		<h3 style = "color:white">Ingredients</h3>
			<ul style = "color: white">
				<li> 1 and ½ cup glutinous rice flour</li>
				<li>80g (about ⅓ cup+ 2tbsp.) sugar</li>
				<li>100ml water or 10ml more for adjusting (include the water for small dough), around ⅓ cup+ 1 tbsp.</li>
				<li>½ teaspoon baking powder (optional)</li>
				<li>1 cup roasted white sesame seeds</li>
				<li>red bean paste or other filling as needed</li>
				<li>water for dipping</li>
				<li>more glutinous rice flour for dusting</li>
				<li>oil for frying </li>
			</ul>
		<h3 style = "color:white">Instructions</h3>
		<h4 style = "color:white">Prepare the small dough</h4>
			<ol style = "color: white">
				<li>In a small bowl, take around 2 tablespoon of glutinous rice flour out and mix with around 10ml water.</li> 
				<li>Knead to until smooth.</li>
				<li>Bring some water to boil and then cook the small dough for around 2 to 3 minutes.</li> 
				<li>Prepare a bowl with cold water on the side.</li>
				<li>Then the small dough is ready, transfer out and soak with cold water to cool down.</li>
			</ol>
		<h4 style = "color:white">Prepare the Main dough</h4>
			<ol style = "color: white">
				<li>In a large bowl, mix the left flour with sugar and baking powder.</li> 
				<li>And then add the small dough in.</li> 
				<li>Break with hand and slowly stir in water.</li> 
				<li>Continue kneading until smooth dough.</li>
				<li>Further shape the dough into long log and then divide into 20 equal portions.</li> 
				<li>Shape each portion into a round ball.</li>
			</ol>
		<h4 style = "color:white">Assemble the Sesame Balls</h4>
			<ol style = "color: white">
				<li>Shape the small glutinous rice balls into a bowl and then wrap around 1 teaspoon red bean paste in.</li> 
				<li>Seal completely and shape into a around ball again.</li> 
				<li>Prepare two bowls: one with clean water and the other with sesame.</li>  
				<li>Take one ball with one hand, quick dip with water and then roll the ball in sesame bowl with another hand.</li>  
				<li>This is a personal tip to make the process easier.</li>  
				<li>Press the balls several times so the sesame seeds can sticky to the surface.</li>  
				<li>Repeat to finish all the sesame balls.</li> 
			</ol>
		<h4 style = "color:white">Frying the Balls</h4>
			<ol style = "color: white">
				<li>Heat enough oil (at lest cover the balls) until 120 degree C (or you can test the temperature with a smaller ball).</li> 
				<li>Carefully add the sesame balls, slow your fire immediately and slowly deep-fry the balls until slightly golden brown.</li> 
				<li>Turn off fire; transfer out and absorb extra oil with paper.</li> 
				<li>Cool down for several minutes and enjoy!</li>
			</ol>
