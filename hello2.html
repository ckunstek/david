	<br>[Verse 1]
    <br>Our love story
    <br>Could be kinda gory
    <br>Far from boring
    <br>We’d meet at a post-apocalypse
    <br>Yeah, I’d be slowly walking
    <br>In a group stalking
    <br>You, you’d be the only man alive
    <br>That I could not resist
    <br>
    <br>[Pre-Chorus]
    <br>Then all of your friends
    <br>They’d try to kill us
    <br>But only because
    <br>They’d be jealous
    <br>That our love is deeper than
    <br>Edward and Bella’s
    <br>
    <br>[Chorus]
    <br>If I were a zombie
    <br>I’d never eat your brain
    <br>I’d just want your heart
    <br>Yeah, I’d want your heart
    <br>I’d just want your heart
    <br>Yeah, oh
    <br>If I were a zombie
    <br>I’d never eat your brain
    <br>I’d just want your heart
    <br>Yeah, I’d want your heart
    <br>I’d just want your heart
    <br>'Cause I want ya
	<br>
	<br>[Verse 2]
	<br>You’d be hiding in
	<br>A second floor apartment
	<br>Knocking all the stairs down to save your life
	<br>From the undead
	<br>Double-barrel shotgun
	<br>Taking out the slow ones
	<br>Then you’d see the passion burning in my eye
	<br>And I’d keep my head
	<br>
	<br>[Pre-Chorus]
	<br>Then all of your friends
	<br>They’d try to kill us
	<br>But only because
	<br>They’d be jealous
	<br>That our love is deeper than
	<br>Edward and Bella’s
	<br>
	<br>[Chorus]
	<br>If I were a zombie
	<br>I’d never eat your brain
	<br>I’d just want your heart
	<br>Yeah, I’d want your heart
	<br>I’d just want your heart
	<br>Yeah, oh
	<br>If I were a zombie
	<br>I’d never eat your brain
	<br>I’d just want your heart
	<br>Yeah, I’d want your heart
	<br>I’d just want your heart
	<br>'Cause I want ya
	<br>
	<br>[Bridge]
	<br>And I’d try not to bite and infect you
	<br>Because I’d respect you too much
	<br>Yeah, that’s why I’d wait until we got married
	<br>Oh, and our happiest days would be spent
	<br>Picking off all your friends
	<br>And they’d see a love this deep won’t stay buried
	<br>
	<br>[Chorus]
	<br>If I were a zombie
	<br>I’d never eat your brain
	<br>I’d just want your heart
	<br>Yeah, I’d want your heart
	<br>I’d just want your heart
	<br>Yeah, oh
	<br>If I were a zombie
	<br>I’d never eat your brain
	<br>I’d just want your heart
	<br>Yeah, I’d want your heart
	<br>I’d just want your heart
	<br>'Cause I want ya
